# Quark

**WORK-IN-PROGRESS: NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN TESTED AS OF YET**

A trimmed down version of the TrimUI Smart's stock operating system with some added goodies. Extract to the root of a FAT32-formatted SD card to install, no strings attached.

* Decompresses to under 150MB, less than double that of the official base package!
* Many more systems to choose from than the stock base package
* RetroArch cores updated to their latest versions from source
* CPU profiles configured for best performance/battery life

## Hotkeys

The following hotkeys will be usable within RetroArch:

* SELECT + L: slow-motion
* SELECT + R: fast-forward
* SELECT + B: exit to MainUI
* SELECT + A: take screenshot (saves in `Saves/screenshots`)
* SELECT + Y: toggle frame rate display
* SELECT + X: open RA menu
* SELECT + D-Pad Up: save state in current slot
* SELECT + D-Pad Down: load state in current slot
