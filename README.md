# Quark

**WORK-IN-PROGRESS: NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN TESTED AS OF YET**

A trimmed down version of the TrimUI Smart's stock operating system with some added goodies, great for small SD cards!  
Installation is as simple as extracting the [latest release](https://github.com/cobaltgit/Quark) into the root of a microSD card formatted with the FAT32 filesystem.

* Decompresses to under 150MB, ideal for maximising games on smaller SD cards!
* Many more systems to choose from than the stock base package, including home computers and ports
* RetroArch cores updated to their latest versions from source
* CPU profiles configured for best performance/battery life balance

## Hotkeys

The following hotkeys will be usable within RetroArch:

* SELECT + L: slow-motion
* SELECT + R: fast-forward
* SELECT + B: exit to MainUI
* SELECT + A: take screenshot (saves in `Saves/screenshots`)
* SELECT + Y: toggle frame rate display
* SELECT + X: open RA menu
* SELECT + D-Pad Right: save state in current slot
* SELECT + D-Pad Left: load state in current slot
